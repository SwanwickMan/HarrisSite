            <p>
                The GU Filmmaking Society aims to bring together students with various levels of experience who are
                passionate about filmmaking.

                Students will be able to learn practical skills such as production, cinematography, directing,
                production design, music production and video editing. This will be achieved through both educational
                workshops and meetings and practical experiences on set producing films and shorter projects.

                Filmmaking will offer students the opportunity to make films, documentaries, music videos and more,
                supporting and collaborating with film-writers, musicians, small businesses, and charities in Glasgow.

                The structure of the society offers equal opportunity to apply for positions of responsibility,
                including roles in the films and projects, the board and head of departments, who are able to teach and
                support members of the society in their area of expertise. This will help members gain valuable skills
                and experience both within and outside of the film-making industry.
